<p> Laurel was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. She is a big family girl, and enjoys the many traditions she has with her family. One of them being that they set up the Christmas tree the day of Thanksgiving! Her family also enjoys taking care of pets, so Laurel has always lived her life having a cat in the house. One of her most memorable times with her family was when her parents took her to New York for the first time this past December! </p>

<p> When Laurel thinks about her future and dreams, many things come to mind. One place that she has always wanted to travel is to Greece. The beautiful buildings, interesting history, and oceans are just a few of the reasons she is craving to travel there. Her dream job is to become a part of something related to design. This can be through software, for example. Also, one of her goals in life is to make a change in the world by helping the environment.
